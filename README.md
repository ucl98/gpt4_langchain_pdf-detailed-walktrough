## Foreword
Every change I did in the gpt4-pdf-chatbot-langchain project, I have included in the "gpt4-pdf-chatbot-langchain" folder.
It should give you a quick overview on what changes need to be done. It needs your api-keys, namespace, .. though. It is not ment to be copied to your gpt4-pdf-chatbot-langchain project.

###### Openai api key

Go to https://platform.openai.com/overview and got "View API keys".

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132441647/235887753-125b598d-664f-4844-91a5-fd8d5dd4c18a.png)

Click "+ Create new secrete key" and copy the key in your ".env" file

###### Pinecone api key

Go to https://app.pinecone.io/organizations/ and create an api key there as well. Add them to the ".env" file.

###### Pinecone index

Create a new pinecone index with the Dimension `1536`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132441647/235887835-80163968-6cbc-47ed-8392-fe604389d793.png)

It should look similar to this:

###### Add pinecone index to the ".env" file

Add the information from your index correct to the .env file. At this point it should look like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132441647/235888151-4e1411ac-140c-452c-9cbd-a74905988571.png)

###### (Optional) Set namespace in config/pinecone.ts

Give the namespace for your vectors a name in "config/pinecone.ts".

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132441647/235887923-bf356cd0-481f-4ec0-ad1a-cf61e9aa5fe2.png)

All vectors that are ingested will be available by this namespace in your pinecone index.
The name you defined in "config/pinecone.ts" will be used to store your ingested data in this namespace, but also lookup your data on a question to the chatbot.
- It is not possible to search data in multiple namespaces simultaneously.

###### Docs folder

Create a folder "docs" where you have your pdf files.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132441647/235887949-f5d8df0d-ecb1-46e6-917f-18bf65adf9ea.png)

###### Ingest your pdf

Run "npm run ingest" in a terminal. This will ingest your pdf into the pinecone database. Remove the pdf document from the "docs" folder, otherwise it will be ingested a second time if you run "npm run ingest" again.

The terminal must be in the project folder at the top level. I have installed "gpt4-pdf-chatbot-langchain" in "Documents".

###### Start appliation

Start the application with "npm run dev" in the terminal. Open a browser and go to the address http://localhost:3000/. You should see the project.

#### Alternative ingest with python

To trouble shoot it might be useful to take a look at my python reimplementation at ingest. It gives more control over each step of ingest.

#### Issues with openai
##### Paid account
Check if you have a paid account. If you see the following message, you need to set up a paid account.
- https://platform.openai.com/account/usage

#### Issues with GPT4 api key
Go to [openai playgroud](https://platform.openai.com/playground?mode=chat) and check if you have access to GPT4. If the model is not available, you will have no access to it and need to use GPT3.5.
- Access to the GPT4 api key does not depend on a ChatGPT subscription. You needd to [apply for it](https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api).

##### Api keys
Another issue can be that your api key is not working. Create a new one and test it again.
